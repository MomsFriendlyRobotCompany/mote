# mote

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/walchko/mote.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/walchko/mote)

simple IoT robot. Currently travis-ci fails to build this for Python 3, but
eventually I would like to make it compatable. It however, does work with
Python 2.7 (not that it does much right this minute) :smile:

## Install

For development you can also do:

    git clone https://github.com/walchko/mote.git
    cd mote
    pip install -U -r requirements.txt
