#
# pi       User-specific group. A group is automatically created for
#          each new user; you can ignore this.
# adm      Allows access to log files in /var/log and using xconsole
# dialout  Allows access to serial ports/modem reconfiguration, etc.
# cdrom    Uncreatively, this group enables access to optical drives.
# sudo     Enables sudo access for the user.
# audio    Allows access to audio devices like microphones and soundcards
# video    Allows graphics card/webcam access.
# plugdev  Enables access to external storage devices
# games    Iâ€™m unsure of this. No files belong to this group by default,
#          and I cannot find references to it online.
# users    Appears to be a Pi-specific group enabling access to
#          /opt/vc/src/hello_pi/ directory and contained files.
# input    Appears to give access to the /dev/input/mice folder and nothing else.
# netdev   Enables access to network interfaces
# gpio     Pi-specific group for GPIO pin access.
# i2c      Similar to the above, but for I2C access.
#          Generated after installing i2c-tools.
# spi      Similar to the above, but for the SPI bus.
